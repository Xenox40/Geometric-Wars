# Geometric Wars

Geometric Wars is a 3D game written in Java and LibGDX. 

# Requirements
* PC: Java 7 or higher
* Android: Android 4.0 or higher

For more informations about game, run jar file or install apk on Android and read how to play.

# How to build from source 
Download source code and sync gradle project (build.gradle file) - it will download all libs needed.

To support more Android devices, we've decided do use Java 7 instead of Java 8, which is supported only on Android 7.0 or higher. 
Also project is ready for writing online multiplayer (using lib Kryonet) and it contains some basic classes for communicating via TCS and UDP, but in current version these classes are not used.
